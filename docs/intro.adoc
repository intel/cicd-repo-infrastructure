== Introduction

This is a repository that is designed to make it easy to set up and maintain
other C++-centric projects, by centralizing code (mostly CMake code) that
runs CI.

Unlike some other projects of this nature, it is not designed for use as a
template repository. Rather, a few lines of CMake code will set up a dependency
on this repository that can then be easily kept up to date.

This repository provides functionality in three areas:

- Github workflows
- CMake utility functions
- CMake toolchains

=== Getting started

First, https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake#adding-cpm[add `get_cpm.cmake`] to
your project's repository. Then, make your CMakeLists.txt file look something
like this at the top:

[source,cmake]
----
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.27)

project(my_project)

include(cmake/get_cpm.cmake)
cpmaddpackage("gh:intel/cicd-repo-infrastructure#main")
----
